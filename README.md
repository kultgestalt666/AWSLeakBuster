# AWSLeakBuster

**AWSLeakBuster** is a command-line tool for scanning AWS accounts for potentially sensitive data that is often overlooked or unintentionally exposed.

It focuses on identifying risky content in:

- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM)
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Lambda environment variables and function code
- EC2 User Data
- (More coming soon...)

## üîç Purpose

AWSLeakBuster helps penetration testers, auditors, and cloud engineers spot misconfigurations and secrets left in AWS services that may expose sensitive data.  
It uses the AWS CLI configuration (`~/.aws/credentials`) to connect via named profiles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Modular architecture (easy to extend)
- CLI with selective scan options
- Designed for offline/whitebox use
- Simple text output (machine-readable export planned)

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python cli.py --profile <aws-profile> --scan ssm-parameters
```

Scan multiple sources at once:

```bash
python cli.py --profile <aws-profile> --scan ssm-parameters ec2
```
